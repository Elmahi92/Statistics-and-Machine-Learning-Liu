In this repository, we explore different solutions to the labs given in the course on Bayesian Learning. This course covers the following topics:

- **Introduction to Bayesian Inference**: Single- and multiparameter models
- **Regression and Classification Models**
- **Advanced Models and Posterior Approximation Methods**
- **Model Evaluation and Comparison**: Including variable selection

Feel free to browse through the labs and solutions. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
