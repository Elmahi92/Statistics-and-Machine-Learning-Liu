In this repository, we explore different solutions to the labs provided in the course **Computational Statistics** at Linköping University. Each lab tackles various aspects of computational methods in statistics, helping to build a strong foundation in both theory and applied techniques.

## Course Labs

1. **Computer Arithmetic**  
   Exploring numerical precision and error handling in computational systems.

2. **Optimization**  
   Solving problems related to optimization, including gradient-based and derivative-free methods.

3. **Random Number Generation**  
   Techniques for generating pseudo-random numbers and understanding their importance in simulations.

4. **Monte Carlo Methods**  
   Application of Monte Carlo techniques for solving problems through statistical sampling.

5. **Numerical Model Selection and Hypothesis Testing**  
   Methods for selecting statistical models using numerical techniques and performing hypothesis testing.

6. **Expectation Maximization Algorithm and Stochastic Optimization**  
   Understanding the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and its use in parameter estimation and optimization under uncertainty.
