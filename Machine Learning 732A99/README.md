## Overview

Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. These algorithms build models from example inputs to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions.

In this repository, we explore various solutions to the labs provided in the Machine Learning course at Linköping University. The focus is on experimenting with different techniques and approaches to solving the assigned tasks.
